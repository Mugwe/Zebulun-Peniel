					<h2>CBO Programs</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Having a CBO that deals with matters of Gender Based Violence and Pro-life most survivors suffer low self esteem and depression, isolation and rejection from the community and family setting there are just a few among many we have a program that is tailored just for them, this helps and enables them walk towards re-integrate them back in to the community and the society at large, the program entails the following;
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<header>
					<h3>Depression or Anxiety</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					These are the two most common general issues our clients present. Mood problems can seriously interfere with sleep, interpersonal relationships, physical health and well-being, concentration, and academic motivation. Counseling can help identify, clarify, and often even simplify problematic thoughts and feelings. When needed, we can also refer you to a psychiatrist here on campus for additional treatment with medication.
				</p>
				<br>

				<header>
					<h3>Relationship Issues</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					It is often helpful to have an outside perspective or help in developing communication skills and strategies for relationships. When a break-up happens, sometimes it is just nice to have an empathetic listener.
				</p>
				<br>

				<header>
					<h3>Social Isolation/Shyness</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					It can be hard to know where to turn when you feel really alone. For some of us, it is especially hard to make new connections and develop close friendships. If this is true for you, remember this is why we are here and we can help.
				</p>
				<br>

				<header>
					<h3>Life Transition Challenges</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Change almost always creates some stress. It can feel overwhelming. We can help you find ways to organize and manage thoughts, feelings, activities, and time.
				</p>
				<br>

				<header>
					<h3>Eating Disorders/Body Image Issues</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					We offer individual assessment, counseling, and referral, along with a therapy group, for these issues, and we work collaboratively with the clinician this helps the clients know how to deal with their self perception.
				</p>
				<br>

				<header>
					<h3>Motivation and Workshops</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Actually, the problem is usually lack of motivation. When it happens, the reasons can be complex and it is hard to just "snap out of it". Counseling and social welfare services can help you identify the underlying reasons for feeling unmotivated and really help you learn how to bring out your best work and pull yourselves together and begin again life has a way of giving an individual a second chance and within the CBO we have experts that help in the process.
