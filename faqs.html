	<h5>What are your hours?</h5>

	<p>Our support staff is available to schedule appointments and answer questions from 9 AM to 4 PM Monday through Friday. Evening appointments are available. </p>

	<h5>What do I do if I have an emergency situation while you are not open for counseling?</h5>

	<p>If you are suicidal, tell someone in your family immediately. You may also dial 911 to help get you to a safe place where you canâ€™t harm yourself.</p>

	<h5>How much does a counseling session cost? What if I cannot afford counseling? </h5>

	<p>Sessions generally last 45 minutes. Our charges are pocket friendly but under extreme cases we come to an agreement with the client and services offered at a reasonable rate that has been agreed on.
	To ensure that clients receive the counseling services they need, Zebulun Counseling Center has a Client Assistance Fund, which is supported by donors, grants and fundraisers. You may request assistance from the Client Assistance Fund to help cover the cost of counseling. Assistance levels are based on family income, number of individuals in the household and availability of funds. All clients are responsible for some portion of the fee. Should this amount still be a financial burden, easy payment plans are available. Please ask about this when you call.

	<p>Second, the Center is accredited by the KENYA CONSELING OF PSYCOLOGICAL ASSOCIASION this ensures that we maintain sound organizational structures, efficient management and administrative skills, high-quality clinical processes, appropriate financial and personnel practices, and professional accountability. On a four year cycle, Centers prepare an extensive self-study, undergo a two day on-site review by an Institute staff member or appointed Center director, and receive a written report on the findings.</p>

We work hand in hand with the association of counseling body in Kenya so help is available.  One such strategy is something known as Interactive Metronome, which is a computer based training program that helps a client work on sequencing, timing and attention.  This procedure has been shown to assist someone with ADD do better at memory and attention and has shown positive results in terms of academic performance.

We can always arrange via networking with other bodies of counselors professionals in this area.</p>
